        Amphibians are a diverse class of cold-blooded vertebrates that include frogs, toads, salamanders,
        newts, and caecilians. They are found in a wide range of habitats, from the tropics to the arctic,
        even in dry environments.

        Metamorphosis, Transitioning from aquatic larvae (tadpoles) with gills to terrestrial adults with lungs.
        This process can involve significant physical changes, such as growing legs and losing their tails.

    <string name="long_description">
        Amphibians are found globally but thrive in moist environments, particularly in tropical regions.
        They possess permeable skin that allows for respiration and water absorption, making their skin
        essential for survival; if it dries out, they can die quickly. Many species also have skin glands
        that produce mucus for moisture retention and toxins for defense against predators12. Their diets
        vary widely; while many eat insects and small invertebrates, some larger species can consume small
        mammals or birds
