The Amphibian Information App
==================================
is a user-friendly mobile application designed to provide comprehensive information about various amphibian species.
This app aims to educate users about the fascinating world of amphibians, including their habitats, behaviors, and conservation status.

Key Features
--------------
- Extensive Database: Access a rich repository of information on amphibians, including detailed descriptions, images, and interesting facts.
- User-Friendly Interface: Navigate effortlessly through a clean and intuitive UI, making it easy for users of all ages to explore amphibian species.
- Search Functionality: Quickly find specific amphibians or browse through categories to discover new species.
- Interactive Features: Engage with the app by interacting with amphibians, such as viewing images, learning about their habitats, and more.

Technical Architecture
---------------
The app is built using Clean Architecture principles, ensuring a well-structured and maintainable codebase. The architecture is divided into three main layers:

1. [Data Layer]: Responsible for managing data sources, including APIs and local databases, ensuring efficient data retrieval and storage.
2. [Model Layer]: Contains the core business logic and data models that represent the amphibian information, facilitating seamless interaction between the data and UI layers.
3. [UI Layer]: Implements a responsive and engaging user interface, leveraging modern design principles for an optimal user experience.

Additional Technologies
---------------
1. [Dependency Injection (DI)]: Utilized to enhance modularity and testability by managing dependencies efficiently.
2. [Navigation]: Implemented to provide smooth transitions between different screens within the app.
3. [Retrofit]: Used for network requests and data parsing.
4. [Coil]: Utilized for image loading and caching.
5. [Coroutines]: Utilized for asynchronous programming and background tasks.
